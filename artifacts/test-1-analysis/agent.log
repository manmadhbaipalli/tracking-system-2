I'll analyze the codebase to understand the current structure and what needs to be built for this FastAPI application. Let me start by exploring the project structure.

> **Glob** `*`

Let me look at the non-git files first:

> **Read** `readme.md`

> **Read** `readme.md`

> **Bash** `Read the readme file to understand project`

Let me check if there are any Python files or other project files:

> **Glob** `**/*.py`

> **Glob** `**/*.{json,yml,yaml,toml,txt,md}`

Let me check what's in the readme:

> **Bash** `List all files in the current directory`

> **Bash** `Check size of readme file`

The readme.md file is empty (0 bytes). This appears to be a blank repository with no existing code. Let me check if there are any configuration files for Python projects:

> **Glob** `**/*requirements*`

> **Glob** `**/{pyproject.toml,setup.py,poetry.lock,Pipfile,Dockerfile,docker-compose.yml}`

This is a completely empty repository. Based on the task requirements, I need to analyze what will be built - a FastAPI application with user authentication, logging, exception handling, circuit breaker, and comprehensive testing. Let me create the required analysis files.

First, let me create the artifacts directory structure:

> **Bash** `Create artifacts directory for analysis`

Now I'll create the CLAUDE.md file with project standards:

> **Write** `CLAUDE.md`

Now I'll create the detailed analysis file:

> **Write** `artifacts/test-1-analysis/analysis.md`

Perfect! I have completed the analysis phase by creating the two required files:

## Analysis Complete

I've successfully analyzed the codebase (which is empty/greenfield) and created the required documentation:

### 1. `CLAUDE.md` - Project Standards
- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, JWT auth, pytest
- **Project Structure**: Complete directory layout for FastAPI app with authentication
- **Coding Conventions**: snake_case, Black formatting, Google docstrings, type hints
- **Commands**: Development server, testing, formatting, and linting commands
- **Key Patterns**: FastAPI structure, JWT auth flow, error handling, database patterns

### 2. `artifacts/test-1-analysis/analysis.md` - Detailed Analysis
- **Overview**: Greenfield FastAPI project with authentication, logging, circuit breaker
- **Affected Areas**: Complete file structure with line estimates for all components
- **Dependencies**: External (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, JWT libraries) and internal dependencies
- **Risks & Edge Cases**: Security, reliability, development, and performance considerations
- **Recommendations**: Phased implementation approach and architecture decisions

## Key Findings
- This is a brand new project requiring complete implementation from scratch
- Will need 15+ Python files covering API, models, services, tests, and configuration
- Main components: user auth system, centralized logging, exception handling, circuit breaker
- Estimated ~600 lines of application code plus comprehensive test suite
- SQLite database with potential for PostgreSQL upgrade path

The analysis provides a solid foundation for the subsequent implementation phases, with clear architectural guidance and risk mitigation strategies.
