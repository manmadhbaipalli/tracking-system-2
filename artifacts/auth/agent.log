I'll start by analyzing the project structure to understand the codebase and then create the required documentation files.

> **Bash** `Find Python files in the project`

> **Bash** `List files in the current directory`

> **Read** `C:\Manmadh\genai\claude-code-agents\workspace\auth-agent-1`

Let me fix the command syntax for Windows/Unix compatibility:

> **Bash** `List files and directories in project root`

> **Glob** `**/*.py`

The project is mostly empty. Let me check the artifacts directory and test.txt:

> **Bash** `List contents of artifacts directory`

> **Read** `test.txt`

Let me check what's in the artifacts/auth directory:

> **Bash** `List contents of artifacts/auth directory`

Let me read the project instructions:

> **Read** `artifacts/auth/prompt.txt`

> **Read** `artifacts/auth/system_prompt_append.txt`

Now I understand. I'm in the **analysis phase**. The project is currently empty (just a skeleton), and I need to:
1. Create `CLAUDE.md` with tech stack, project structure, conventions, commands, and patterns
2. Create `artifacts/auth/analysis.md` with analysis of what needs to be built

Since this is a greenfield project (starting from scratch) for a FastAPI authentication system, I'll design the structure and document it. Let me create both files:

> **Write** `CLAUDE.md`

Now let me create the analysis document:

> **Write** `artifacts/auth/analysis.md`

Perfect! I've completed the **analysis phase** by creating the two required documentation files:

## Summary

### 1. **CLAUDE.md** - Project Standards Reference
Created a comprehensive standards document that covers:
- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, pytest, pydantic
- **Project Structure**: Organized directory layout for app, auth, middleware, and tests
- **Coding Conventions**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes, type hints throughout
- **Commands**: How to install, run, test, and access API docs
- **Key Patterns**: Dependency injection, async database, error handling, middleware, circuit breaker

### 2. **artifacts/auth/analysis.md** - Task Analysis
Detailed analysis document containing:
- **Overview**: Greenfield FastAPI auth system with 5 major components
- **Affected Areas**: 10+ files to create (models, routes, middleware, tests)
- **Dependencies**: JWT tokens, User model, and get_current_user() dependency
- **Risks & Edge Cases**: Security (passwords, JWT), operational (DB errors, rate limiting), technical (async, case sensitivity)
- **Recommendations**: Implementation order, architecture decisions, testing strategy, database schema, and API contract

These documents provide a complete blueprint for the subsequent implementation phases. The analysis phase is complete and ready for the next agent to proceed with design and implementation.
