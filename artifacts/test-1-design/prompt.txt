## Task: test-1-design
**[DESIGN] test-1**

**Pipeline:** `test-1` | **Phase:** `design`

## Description
1. Build the FastAPI app
	a) Add user registration and login endpoints
	b) Enable Swagger/OpenAPI docs for all endpoints
	c) Add centralized logging
	d) Add centralized exception handling
	e) Implement a circuit breaker for external calls / unstable operations
2. Design the solution
	a) Create PlantUML sequence + flow diagrams
	b) Design the database schema (tables + relationships)
3. Implement with tests
	a) Write the application code
	b) Add proper test cases (unit + integration where needed)
4.Run the tests
	a) Execute the test suite and confirm it passes
5. Review and optimize
	a) Fix issues found in testing/review
	b) Improve performance/structure where necessary without changing behavior

## Phase: design
Design the implementation approach. Read the analysis from the previous phase. Create a detailed technical design in artifacts/{task_id}/design.md.

**Note:** This task depended on: test-1-analysis. Those are now merged into main.

## File Constraints
You may ONLY modify these files (other files are locked by other agents working in parallel):
  (no file restrictions — you may modify any file)

If you need to create new files, place them under the directories implied by the locked file paths.
Do NOT modify files outside your assigned scope — doing so will cause merge conflicts.
