I'll start by reading the analysis from the previous phase and the project's CLAUDE.md file to understand the requirements and context.

> **Read** `artifacts/test-1-analysis/analysis.md`

> **Read** `CLAUDE.md`

Now I'll create the design artifacts. First, I'll create the directory structure and then write the features.json file and design.md file.

> **Bash** `Create design artifacts directory`

> **Write** `artifacts/test-1-design/features.json`

> **Write** `artifacts/test-1-design/design.md`

I've created the technical design for the FastAPI application. Here's what I've delivered:

## Design Artifacts Created

### 1. **features.json** 
A comprehensive list of 22 implementation features covering:
- Project configuration files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
- Core infrastructure (database, config, security, logging, exceptions)  
- Data models (User model and Pydantic schemas)
- Business logic (authentication service, circuit breaker)
- API layer (endpoints, dependencies, main app)
- Package initialization files

Each feature includes:
- Unique identifier
- File path (relative to project root)
- Clear description of what needs to be implemented
- Acceptance criteria for verification
- Status tracking (all set to "pending")

### 2. **design.md** 
A detailed technical design with:

**Approach**: Layered architecture with separation of concerns between API, service, data, and core utility layers

**Detailed Changes**: File-by-file breakdown of what needs to be implemented, including:
- Dependencies and versions
- Database schema design
- Security implementation details
- API endpoint specifications

**Interfaces**: Complete API contracts for registration/login endpoints with request/response examples, plus service layer method signatures

**Trade-offs**: Analysis of key architectural decisions (SQLite vs PostgreSQL, JWT vs sessions, bcrypt vs Argon2, library vs custom circuit breaker)

**Open Questions**: 6 implementation decisions for the next phase regarding password requirements, token refresh, user activation, rate limiting, logging sensitivity, and database migrations

The design follows the project's established patterns from CLAUDE.md and addresses all requirements from the task description while maintaining focus on security, reliability, and maintainability.
