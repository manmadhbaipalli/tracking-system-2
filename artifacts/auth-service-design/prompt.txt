You are an autonomous coding agent. Your job is to complete the task below.

## Task: auth-service-design
**[DESIGN] auth-service**

**Pipeline:** `auth-service` | **Phase:** `design`

## Description
1. Analyze the below requirement
	1. Create fastapi application with login, registration endpoints
	2. centralized logging system
	3. centralized exception handling
	4. implement circuit breaker
	5. swagger for all endpoints
2. Design the application
	1. Sequence Diagrams and flow diagrams in platuml
	2. design and create the db schema/tables
3. code implementation with proper testcases
4. execute testcases
5. review and optimize if any issues.

## Phase: design
Design the implementation approach. Read the analysis from the previous phase. Create a detailed technical design in artifacts/{task_id}/design.md.

**Note:** This task depended on: auth-service-analysis. Those are now merged into main.

## File Constraints
You may ONLY modify these files (other files are locked by other agents working in parallel):
  (no file restrictions — you may modify any file)

If you need to create new files, place them under the directories implied by the locked file paths.
Do NOT modify files outside your assigned scope — doing so will cause merge conflicts.

## Phase Role: Design
You are the **design agent**. Your job is to create a detailed technical design based on the analysis.

### Prior Work
Read the analysis artifact from the previous phase at `artifacts/auth-service-analysis/analysis.md` — it contains the codebase exploration findings, affected areas, and recommendations.

### What to do
1. Read the analysis artifact carefully
2. Design the solution architecture — components, data flow, interfaces
3. Define the specific code changes needed (file-by-file)
4. Plan the API contracts / interfaces if applicable
5. Consider backward compatibility and migration paths

### Output
Write your design to `artifacts/auth-service-design/design.md` with these sections:
- **Approach**: High-level solution strategy
- **Detailed Changes**: File-by-file breakdown of what to add/modify/delete
- **Interfaces**: New or modified APIs, function signatures, types
- **Trade-offs**: Why this approach over alternatives
- **Open Questions**: Anything the implementation agent should decide


## Quality Requirements
- Write tests for any new functionality
- Do not break existing tests
- Follow the project's coding standards (see below)
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the task

## Project Standards
(No CLAUDE.md found — follow existing patterns in the codebase.)
