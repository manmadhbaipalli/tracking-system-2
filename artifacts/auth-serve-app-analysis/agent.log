I'll analyze the codebase to understand the current state and requirements for building the FastAPI auth service app. Let me start by exploring the project structure and understanding what exists.

> **Glob** `*`

Let me check what's in the project root more clearly:

> **Bash** `List all files and directories in project root`

Now let me read the test.txt file to see what's there:

> **Read** `test.txt`

The project appears to be a fresh repository with just a test.txt file. Let me check if there are any existing Python files or configuration files:

> **Glob** `**/*.py`

> **Glob** `**/*.{json,toml,txt,yml,yaml,md,cfg,ini}`

Let me check the artifacts directory to understand the context better:

> **Read** `artifacts/auth-serve-app-analysis/prompt.txt`

Now I understand! This is a completely fresh project and I need to analyze the requirements to build a FastAPI authentication service from scratch. Let me start by creating the required analysis files.

Since this is a greenfield project, I need to:
1. Create the `CLAUDE.md` file with project standards for future agents
2. Create the `artifacts/auth-serve-app-analysis/analysis.md` file with my analysis

Let me start by writing the CLAUDE.md file:

> **Write** `CLAUDE.md`

Now let me create the analysis file:

> **Write** `artifacts/auth-serve-app-analysis/analysis.md`

Perfect! I've completed the analysis phase by creating both required files:

## Summary

I've successfully analyzed the requirements for the auth-serve-app project and created:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - A comprehensive project standards document that includes:
   - Tech stack (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, JWT, PostgreSQL/SQLite)
   - Detailed project structure with 30+ files to be created
   - Coding conventions following Python best practices
   - Key commands for development workflow
   - Architecture patterns (dependency injection, repository pattern, etc.)

2. **`artifacts/auth-serve-app-analysis/analysis.md`** - A thorough analysis covering:
   - Overview of the greenfield FastAPI authentication service
   - Complete list of files that need to be created (with line references)
   - Dependencies required for production and development
   - Security, operational, and performance risks with mitigation strategies  
   - Implementation recommendations and architecture decisions

The analysis reveals this is a completely new project requiring a full FastAPI authentication service with user registration, login, JWT tokens, database integration, logging, exception handling, and circuit breakers. The next phases can use this analysis to systematically build out the application following the established patterns and standards.
