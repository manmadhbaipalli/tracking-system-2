I'll help you test the auth implementation. Let me start by understanding the current state of the project and what was implemented.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "C:\\Manmadh\\genai\\claude-code-agents\\workspace\\auth-agent-1\\CLAUDE.md"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "C:\\Manmadh\\genai\\claude-code-agents\\workspace\\auth-agent-1\\artifacts\\auth-implement\\features.json"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "C:\\Manmadh\\genai\\claude-code-agents\\workspace\\auth-agent-1\\artifacts\\auth-implement\\implementation.md"}
Let me check what files are available:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find C:\\Manmadh\\genai\\claude-code-agents\\workspace\\auth-agent-1 -type f -name \"*.md\" | head -20"}
Let me check the working directory and project structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "pwd && ls -la"}
Good! Now let me check the artifacts and implementation details:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find ./artifacts -type f | head -20"}
Now let me read the design features and implementation details:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-agent-1/artifacts/auth-design/features.json"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-agent-1/artifacts/auth-implement/harness-test-output.txt"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-agent-1/CLAUDE.md"}
Now let me check the project structure to understand what's been implemented:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find ./app -type f -name \"*.py\" | sort"}
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find ./app -type f -name \"*.py\" | wc -l && find ./tests -type f -name \"*.py\" 2>/dev/null | wc -l"}
Let me check what's in the app directory more thoroughly:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -laR ./app"}
I see the implementation is incomplete. Let me check if there are more details in the implementation artifacts:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la ./artifacts/auth-implement/"}
I see the implementation is incomplete - only the base models and config exist. Let me check the agent log to understand what happened:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-agent-1/artifacts/auth-implement/agent.log"}
