I'll start by reading the analysis artifact from the previous phase and the CLAUDE.md file to understand the project requirements and standards.

> **Read** `artifacts/auth-serve-analysis/analysis.md`

> **Read** `CLAUDE.md`

Now I need to create the design artifacts directory and then create the features.json and design.md files based on the analysis.

> **Bash** `Create design artifacts directory`

Now I'll create the features.json file with all the source code components that need to be implemented:

> **Write** `artifacts/auth-serve-design/features.json`

Now I'll create the detailed design document:

> **Write** `artifacts/auth-serve-design/design.md`

Perfect! I've successfully created the technical design for the auth-serve project. The design includes:

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive technical design with:

**artifacts/auth-serve-design/features.json** - Contains 20 specific implementation features covering:
- Dependencies and configuration files
- Core application structure (FastAPI setup, database, models)
- Authentication and security components (JWT, password hashing)
- API endpoints for registration and login
- Infrastructure components (logging, exception handling, circuit breaker)
- Database migrations and configuration

**artifacts/auth-serve-design/design.md** - Provides detailed technical specifications including:
- **Approach**: Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Detailed Changes**: File-by-file breakdown of what needs to be implemented
- **Interfaces**: API endpoint specifications and internal function signatures
- **Trade-offs**: Analysis of design decisions and alternatives considered
- **Open Questions**: 7 implementation decisions for the next phase to resolve

The design follows the project's coding standards from CLAUDE.md and addresses all requirements from the analysis phase:
- FastAPI with async/await patterns
- JWT authentication with proper security
- SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations
- Centralized logging and exception handling
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- Comprehensive test setup foundation

The features.json serves as the implementation contract with clear acceptance criteria for each component, focusing only on source code files (excluding tests and documentation as specified).
