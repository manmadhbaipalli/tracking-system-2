I'll analyze the auth-spects-app codebase to understand its structure, dependencies, and requirements. Let me start by exploring the project.

> **Bash** `Find Python files to understand project structure`

> **Read** `C:\Manmadh\genai\claude-code-agents\workspace\auth-spects-app-agent-1`

Let me check the directory structure properly:

> **Glob** `**/*.py`

> **Glob** `**/*.txt`

> **Glob** `**/*.md`

Now let me read the key files to understand the current state:

> **Read** `CLAUDE.md`

> **Read** `requirements.txt`

> **Read** `app/main.py`

Let me continue reading core files to understand the implementation:

> **Read** `app/config.py`

> **Read** `app/database.py`

> **Read** `app/models/user.py`

Let me read more core files:

> **Read** `app/models/schemas.py`

> **Read** `app/routes/auth.py`

> **Read** `app/services/auth_service.py`

Let me check the dependencies, utilities, and middleware:

> **Read** `app/dependencies.py`

> **Read** `app/utils/exceptions.py`

> **Read** `app/utils/logger.py`

Let me check middleware and other utility files:

> **Read** `app/middleware/exception.py`

> **Read** `app/middleware/logging.py`

> **Read** `app/utils/circuit_breaker.py`

Now let me check the services and other utilities:

> **Read** `app/services/user_service.py`

> **Read** `app/utils/jwt.py`

> **Read** `app/routes/health.py`

Let me check the test configuration to understand the testing setup:

> **Read** `tests/conftest.py`

> **Bash** `List test files to understand test structure`

Now let me check one of the previous analysis files to understand the format expected:

> **Read** `artifacts/test-1-analysis/analysis.md`
