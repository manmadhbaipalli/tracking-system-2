You are an autonomous coding agent. A previous attempt at task auth-serve-app-implement failed CI.

## Task
**[IMPLEMENT] auth-serve-app**
1. Build the FastAPI app
	a) Add user registration and login endpoints
	b) Enable Swagger/OpenAPI docs for all endpoints
	c) Add centralized logging
	d) Add centralized exception handling
	e) Implement a circuit breaker for external calls / unstable operations
2. Design the solution
	a) Create PlantUML sequence + flow diagrams
	b) Design the database schema (tables + relationships)
3. Implement with tests
	a) Write the application code
	b) Add proper test cases (unit + integration where needed)
4.Run the tests
	a) Execute the test suite and confirm it passes
5. Review and optimize
	a) Fix issues found in testing/review
	b) Improve performance/structure where necessary without changing behavior

## Phase: implement
Implement the feature based on the design. Read the design from the previous phase. Write production code and update artifacts/{task_id}/implementation.md.

## CI Failure Output

```

## Instructions
1. Read the failing test output carefully.
2. Identify the root cause.
3. Fix the code. Only modify files in your assigned scope.
4. Run the tests again to verify the fix.
5. Update `artifacts/auth-serve-app-implement/findings.md` with what went wrong and how you fixed it.
