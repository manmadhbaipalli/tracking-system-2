I'll start by exploring the codebase structure to understand what we're working with and then provide the analysis for building the FastAPI authentication service.

> **Bash** `Check current working directory`

> **Glob** `*`

This appears to be a mostly empty repository with just a test.txt file. Let me check the existing files to understand the current state:

> **Read** `test.txt`

> **Glob** `**/*`

Let me check if there are any Python files, requirements files, or other project files that might not be showing up:

> **Bash** `List all files including hidden ones`

This is essentially an empty project with just a git repository and an empty test.txt file. Let me also check what's in the artifacts directory to understand the task context better:

> **Read** `artifacts/auth-serve-analysis/prompt.txt`

> **Read** `artifacts/auth-serve-analysis/system_prompt_append.txt`

Now I understand the task. This is a greenfield project where I need to analyze the requirements for building a FastAPI authentication service from scratch. Since this is an empty repository, I'll create the analysis based on what needs to be built.

Let me create the two required files:

> **Write** `CLAUDE.md`

> **Write** `artifacts/auth-serve-analysis/analysis.md`

Perfect! I've completed the analysis phase by creating the two required files:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - This file provides the coding standards and project structure that will guide all subsequent development phases. It includes:
   - Complete tech stack (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, JWT, etc.)
   - Detailed project structure with directory explanations
   - Coding conventions (naming, formatting, type hints)
   - Development commands for running, testing, and deploying
   - Key architectural patterns to follow

2. **`artifacts/auth-serve-analysis/analysis.md`** - This file contains the detailed analysis of what needs to be built:
   - Overview of the greenfield FastAPI authentication service
   - All files that need to be created (since this is a new project)
   - Dependencies and external libraries required
   - Security, technical, and operational risks to consider
   - Step-by-step implementation recommendations

The analysis reveals this is a complete greenfield project where we need to build a FastAPI authentication service from scratch with user registration, login, JWT tokens, centralized logging, exception handling, and circuit breaker patterns. The files provide a comprehensive roadmap for the subsequent implementation phases.
