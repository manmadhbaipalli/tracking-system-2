I'll start by analyzing this project to understand its structure and then create the analysis documentation.

> **Bash** `Find relevant project files to understand structure`

> **Read** `C:\Manmadh\genai\claude-code-agents\workspace\test-srv-1-agent-1`

Let me fix that and explore the directory structure properly.

> **Bash** `List all files and directories in project root`

The project is mostly empty. Let me check what's in the artifacts directory and test.txt:

> **Read** `C:\Manmadh\genai\claude-code-agents\workspace\test-srv-1-agent-1\test.txt`

> **Bash** `List contents of artifacts directory`

Let me check the git log to understand the project history:

> **Bash** `Show recent git commit history`

This is a brand-new project. Based on the task description, I need to build a FastAPI application with user registration/login, API docs, logging, exception handling, and a circuit breaker. Let me create the analysis documentation as required.

> **Write** `C:\Manmadh\genai\claude-code-agents\workspace\test-srv-1-agent-1\CLAUDE.md`

> **Write** `C:\Manmadh\genai\claude-code-agents\workspace\test-srv-1-agent-1\artifacts\test\analysis.md`

Perfect! I've completed the analysis phase. Here's what I've created:

## Summary

I've generated two comprehensive documentation files for your FastAPI project:

### 1. **CLAUDE.md** - Project Standards Reference
Contains:
- **Tech Stack**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, JWT, pytest, pybreaker
- **Project Structure**: Clear directory layout with all 14 modules to be created
- **Coding Conventions**: PEP 8, type hints, async patterns
- **Commands**: How to install, run, test, and lint the project
- **Key Patterns**: Dependency injection, Pydantic models, middleware, circuit breaker

### 2. **artifacts/test/analysis.md** - Detailed Implementation Guide
Contains:
- **Overview**: What we're building and why
- **Affected Areas**: All 14 modules with descriptions
- **Key Dependencies**: All required packages for the full feature set
- **Risks & Edge Cases**: Security concerns, database issues, circuit breaker edge cases
- **Recommendations**: Step-by-step implementation approach, testing strategy, security checklist

## Next Steps
The analysis phase is complete. The next agent(s) can now:
1. Build the design (PlantUML sequence/flow diagrams + database schema)
2. Implement the FastAPI application with all endpoints
3. Write comprehensive test suites
4. Run tests and validate the implementation
5. Optimize and review for production readiness

All standards and guidelines are documented in **CLAUDE.md** for consistency across the team.
