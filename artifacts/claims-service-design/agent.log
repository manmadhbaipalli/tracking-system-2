I'll start by reading the analysis from the previous phase and understanding the project structure, then create a detailed technical design for the claims service platform.

> **Read** `CLAUDE.md`

Now I'll create the technical design based on the analysis. First, let me create the artifacts directory and the required design files.

> **Write** `artifacts/claims-service-design/features.json`

> **Write** `artifacts/claims-service-design/design.md`

## Design Complete

I've successfully created the technical design for the claims service platform based on the analysis from the previous phase. The design includes:

### Key Design Artifacts Created:

1. **`artifacts/claims-service-design/features.json`** - Implementation roadmap with 40 specific features covering:
   - Backend infrastructure (FastAPI, database, security)
   - Data models (Policy, Claim, Payment, User, Audit)
   - API endpoints and business logic services
   - Frontend React components and pages
   - Configuration and deployment files

2. **`artifacts/claims-service-design/design.md`** - Comprehensive technical design covering:
   - **Layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns
   - **Database design** with PostgreSQL and field-level encryption for PII
   - **Security approach** with JWT authentication and PCI compliance
   - **API contracts** for policy search, claims management, and payment processing
   - **Frontend architecture** with React/TypeScript and WCAG compliance

### Key Architectural Decisions:

- **PostgreSQL** with field-level encryption for sensitive data (SSN/TIN, payment info)
- **Claims can override policy data** without affecting original policy records
- **Comprehensive audit logging** for all operations with user context
- **Service layer abstractions** for external integrations (Stripe, ACH, EDI)
- **Role-based access control** with JWT tokens
- **Responsive React frontend** with accessibility compliance

The design provides a complete blueprint for building an integrated insurance platform that handles policies, claims, and payments with enterprise-grade security and compliance features. The implementation agent now has 40 clearly defined features with acceptance criteria to build the complete system.
