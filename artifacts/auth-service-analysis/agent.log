I'll start by exploring the codebase to understand the current state of the project and then write the analysis documents.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1 -type f -name \"*.py\" -o -name \"*.txt\" -o -name \"*.md\" -o -name \"*.sql\" -o -name \"*.puml\" | head -30"}
Good, the project structure exists. Let me check if there are existing Python files in the app directory:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1/app -type f -name \"*.py\" 2>/dev/null | head -20"}
Let me check the current directory structure:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1/"}
Let me check if there's an app directory and existing files:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1/ | grep -E \"^d\""}
Let me check the existing analysis documents:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1/CLAUDE.md"}
Now let me check the existing analysis documents:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1/artifacts/auth-service-analysis/analysis.md"}
Good! The analysis document already exists. Let me check the existing prompt.txt to see what phase was already completed:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1/artifacts/auth-service-analysis/prompt.txt"}
Now let me check the git status to see if the prompt.txt file has been modified:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "cd /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1 && git diff --name-only"}
Good! The only file that's changed is the prompt.txt. Now I need to understand the current state of the project better. Let me check what artifacts already exist:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1/artifacts/auth-service-analysis/"}
Let me check the diagrams:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1/artifacts/auth-service-analysis/diagrams/"}
