I'll analyze the codebase to understand the current state and requirements for the auth-service. Let me start by exploring the project structure.

The analysis is complete! I've thoroughly explored the codebase and documented my findings.

## Summary

The auth-service codebase is **substantially implemented** with a solid foundation:

**✅ Already Complete:**
- FastAPI application with login/registration endpoints
- Centralized logging system with JSON formatting and correlation IDs  
- Centralized exception handling with custom exceptions
- Circuit breaker implementation (async-compatible)
- JWT authentication with secure password hashing
- Swagger documentation (built into FastAPI)
- Database models and migrations
- Configuration management

**❌ Still Needed:**
- **Test suite** (completely missing - no tests directory exists)
- **PlantUML diagrams** for design documentation  
- Enhanced user management endpoints
- Integration of circuit breakers into actual endpoints
- Production hardening

The codebase follows excellent patterns and is ready for testing and enhancement phases. The existing `CLAUDE.md` accurately reflects the project standards and structure.

**Key Files Created:**
- `artifacts/auth-service-analysis/analysis.md` - Comprehensive analysis with affected areas, dependencies, risks, and recommendations
- `CLAUDE.md` - Already exists and accurately documents the project standards

The foundation is solid - the next phases should focus on comprehensive testing, design documentation, and extending functionality rather than refactoring existing code.
