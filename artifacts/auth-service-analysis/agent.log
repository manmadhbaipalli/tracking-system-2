I'll start by exploring the codebase to understand the current project structure and analyze what needs to be built for the auth service. Let me begin by examining the project layout.

> **Bash** `Explore project structure to identify files and tech stack`

> **Bash** `List all files and directories in the project root`

> **Read** `test.txt`

> **Bash** `Check artifacts directory contents`

> **Bash** `Check contents of auth-service-analysis directory`

> **Read** `artifacts/auth-service-analysis/prompt.txt`

> **Read** `artifacts/auth-service-analysis/system_prompt_append.txt`

> **Bash** `Search for project configuration files`

> **Bash** `Look for gitignore or environment files`

> **Bash** `Check git history for project context`

Now I understand the scope. This is a fresh project where I need to analyze requirements for building a FastAPI authentication service. Since there's no existing code, my analysis will focus on planning the structure and identifying what needs to be built.

Let me create the two required files based on my analysis.

> **Write** `CLAUDE.md`

> **Write** `artifacts/auth-service-analysis/analysis.md`

I have completed the analysis phase for the FastAPI authentication service. Since this is a greenfield project (currently empty), I've analyzed the requirements and created the two required files:

## ✅ Analysis Complete

**1. `CLAUDE.md`** - Coding standards reference with:
- Tech stack (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, JWT, pytest)
- Complete project structure layout
- Coding conventions and formatting rules
- Commands for running, testing, and building
- Key patterns for dependency injection and error handling

**2. `artifacts/auth-service-analysis/analysis.md`** - Detailed analysis including:
- Project overview and tech stack assessment
- All files that need to be created (complete greenfield implementation)
- Dependencies and external libraries required
- Risk assessment covering security, database, and operational concerns
- Implementation recommendations with database schema design

## Key Findings
- **Scope**: Complete FastAPI auth service implementation from scratch
- **Core Features**: User registration/login, JWT authentication, Swagger docs, centralized logging/exceptions, circuit breaker
- **Security Focus**: Proper password hashing, JWT security, rate limiting, input validation
- **Database Design**: User and refresh token tables with proper constraints and indexing

The analysis provides a solid foundation for the implementation phases that will follow.
