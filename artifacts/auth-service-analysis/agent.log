I'll analyze the auth-service project to understand the requirements and existing codebase structure. Let me start by exploring the current state of the project.
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /c/Manmadh/Workspaces/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1 -type f -name \"*.py\" -o -name \"*.md\" -o -name \"*.txt\" -o -name \"*.yml\" -o -name \"*.yaml\" | head -50", "description": "List project files to understand current state"}
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "/c/Manmadh/Workspaces/claude-code-agents/workspace/auth-service-agent-1"}

[RESULT] Completed in 3 turns, cost=$0.0234
