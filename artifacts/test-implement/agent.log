I'll implement the FastAPI authentication service based on the design. Let me start by reading the design document and features list.
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "C:\\Manmadh\\genai\\claude-code-agents\\workspace\\test-agent-1\\artifacts\\test-design\\design.md"}
Now let me read the features.json file to understand the implementation contract:
[tool_use] Read: {"file_path": "C:\\Manmadh\\genai\\claude-code-agents\\workspace\\test-agent-1\\artifacts\\test-design\\features.json"}
Now let me check the project structure to see what exists:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "find /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/test-agent-1 -type f -name \"*.py\" -o -name \"*.txt\" -o -name \"*.md\" | head -30"}
Let me check if there are any existing app files:
[tool_use] Bash: {"command": "ls -la /c/Manmadh/genai/claude-code-agents/workspace/test-agent-1/ | grep -E \"^d\""}
I need to create the full FastAPI application. Let me start implementing all the features systematically. First, let me create a todo list to track progress:
[tool_use] TodoWrite: {"todos": [{"content": "Create project structure and init files", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Creating project structure and init files"}, {"content": "Create requirements.txt and setup files", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Creating requirements.txt and setup files"}, {"content": "

[RESULT] Completed in 6 turns, cost=$0.0523
