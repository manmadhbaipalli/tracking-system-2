You are an autonomous coding agent. Your job is to complete the task below.

## Task: auth-service-test
**[TEST] auth-service**

**Pipeline:** `auth-service` | **Phase:** `test`

## Description
1. Analyze the below requirement
	1. Create fastapi application with login, registration endpoints
	2. centralized logging system
	3. centralized exception handling
	4. implement circuit breaker
	5. swagger for all endpoints
2. Design the application
	1. Sequence Diagrams and flow diagrams in platuml
	2. design and create the db schema/tables
3. code implementation with proper testcases
4. execute testcases
5. review and optimize if any issues.

## Phase: test
Write tests and validate the implementation. Read the implementation from the previous phase. Run tests and document results in artifacts/{task_id}/test-results.md.

**Note:** This task depended on: auth-service-implement. Those are now merged into main.

## File Constraints
You may ONLY modify these files (other files are locked by other agents working in parallel):
  (no file restrictions — you may modify any file)

If you need to create new files, place them under the directories implied by the locked file paths.
Do NOT modify files outside your assigned scope — doing so will cause merge conflicts.

## Phase Role: Testing
You are the **testing agent**. Your job is to write tests and validate the implementation.

### Prior Work
Read the implementation artifact from the previous phase at `artifacts/auth-service-implement/implementation.md` — it describes what was implemented and any deviations from design.

### What to do
1. Read the implementation artifact carefully
2. Review the actual code changes to understand what was implemented
3. Write unit tests for new functionality
4. Write integration tests if applicable
5. Run all tests (new and existing) and fix any failures
6. Check edge cases identified in the analysis phase

### Output
Write your test results to `artifacts/auth-service-test/test-results.md` with these sections:
- **Tests Written**: List of new test files/functions
- **Test Coverage**: What scenarios are covered
- **Test Results**: Pass/fail summary
- **Issues Found**: Any bugs or regressions discovered (and whether fixed)


## Quality Requirements
- Write tests for any new functionality
- Do not break existing tests
- Follow the project's coding standards (see below)
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the task

## Project Standards
(No CLAUDE.md found — follow existing patterns in the codebase.)
