I'll analyze the codebase for the claims service requirements. Let me start by exploring the project structure to understand the current state.

> **Glob** `*`

> **Read** `readme.md`

> **Read** `readme.md`

> **Glob** `**/*.py`

> **Glob** `**/*.js`

> **Glob** `**/*.{jsx,tsx,ts,json,yaml,yml,txt,md}`

> **Bash** `Read the readme file content`

> **Read** `artifacts/claims-service-analysis/prompt.txt`

> **Glob** `.*`

> **Read** `artifacts/claims-service-analysis/system_prompt_append.txt`

Now I understand the task. This is a greenfield project for an integrated insurance platform, and I need to analyze the requirements and create the foundational analysis files. Let me create the two required files based on the Business Requirements Document.

> **Write** `CLAUDE.md`

> **Write** `artifacts/claims-service-analysis/analysis.md`

I have completed the analysis phase for the claims service platform. Since this is a greenfield project, I've created the two required foundational files:

## Files Created:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Development standards and coding conventions that all subsequent agents will follow, including:
   - Recommended tech stack (ReactJS/TypeScript frontend, Python/FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database)
   - Project structure for both frontend and backend
   - Coding conventions for Python and TypeScript
   - Commands for development, testing, and deployment
   - Key patterns for security, data flow, and integrations

2. **`artifacts/claims-service-analysis/analysis.md`** - Comprehensive analysis covering:
   - System overview and key entry points to be created
   - All modules that need to be built (policies, claims, payments, auth, audit)
   - External dependencies and integrations required
   - Security, performance, and compliance risks
   - Phased implementation recommendations and testing strategy

The analysis identifies this as a complex insurance platform requiring:
- Sophisticated policy search and management
- Claims processing with audit trails
- Multi-method payment processing with PCI compliance
- Role-based access control and comprehensive logging
- Integration with external payment processors and EDI systems

The recommendations outline a 5-phase implementation approach starting with core infrastructure and progressing through policy management, claims processing, payment processing, and advanced integrations.
