I'll start by reading the analysis artifact and CLAUDE.md to understand the requirements and design approach.

> **Read** `artifacts/auth-spects-app-analysis/analysis.md`

> **Read** `CLAUDE.md`

Let me check what files exist in the artifacts directory:

> **Bash** `find artifacts -type f -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | head -20`

> **Bash** `ls -la CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "CLAUDE.md not found"`

Let me check for the auth-spects-app analysis:

> **Bash** `find artifacts -type d -name "*auth-spects*"`

> **Read** `CLAUDE.md`

Now let me read the analysis artifact:

> **Read** `artifacts/auth-spects-app-analysis/analysis.md`

Let me check if there's any analysis file:

> **Bash** `ls -la artifacts/auth-spects-app-analysis/`

Let me check the system prompt append to understand the analysis:

> **Read** `artifacts/auth-spects-app-analysis/system_prompt_append.txt`

Good! Now I understand the task. The analysis phase has already created CLAUDE.md with comprehensive standards. Now I need to create the design phase artifacts. Let me check what currently exists:

> **Bash** `ls -la artifacts/auth-spects-app-design/`

Now let me check the current project state to understand what exists:

> **Bash** `ls -la app/ 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "app directory doesn't exist yet"`

Good! The project structure is set up. Let me examine the existing code to understand what's already in place:

> **Read** `app/main.py`

> **Read** `app/config.py`

> **Read** `app/database.py`

> **Read** `app/dependencies.py`

Let me check what models and utilities exist:

> **Bash** `find app -type f -name "*.py" | sort`
